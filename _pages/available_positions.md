# Available Positions

**Updated October 2024**: Multiple postdocs and research scientist positions on [AI weather forecasting across scales](https://pedram.rice.edu/files/2024/10/AIweather_Postdoc2024-1.pdf) (from daily to seasonal-to-seasonal).

**Updated September 2024**: Our new group at The University of Chicago has multiple positions for Ph.D. students, postdoctoral fellows, and research scientists interested in working on multidisciplinary projects in the following general areas (and at their intersections)

1. Applications of deep learning to improve analysis, modeling, and prediction of climate variability, weather extremes, and geophysical turbulence (with a focus on subgrid-scale modeling and spatio-temporal forecast/emulation from daily to S2S to decadal time scales). In particular, there are a few openings in this area for the DataWave project and our new efforts around human-centered AI weather forecast at the daily to S2S scales.

2. Extreme weather events and climate change (with a focus on dynamics and the extratropical atmospheric circulation),

3. Scientific deep learning for multi-scale nonlinear dynamical systems (with a focus on developing general, rigorous frameworks for explainability and analysis),

We are looking for highly motivated applicants with strong backgrounds in one or more of these areas: climate dynamics, geophysical fluid dynamics, applied math, scientific deep learning, numerical analysis, and turbulence physics.

All Ph.D. students and researchers will benefit from our group’s involvement in multi-institutional, international collaborative projects such as the Schmidt Futures-supported [DataWave](https://datawaveproject.github.io) and InMOS, and NSF-supported [GW-CSSI](https://cssi-gws.github.io/index.html). They will also benefit from UChicago’s thriving and expanding programs in [AI for Climate](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/research/aice-ai-for-climate/), [Climate Science](https://geosci.uchicago.edu/research/atmospheres-oceans-ice-and-climate/), [AI+Science](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/research/ai-science/), [Computational and Applied Math](https://cam.uchicago.edu/about/), [Data Science](https://datascience.uchicago.edu), and [Climate Systems Engineering](https://climateengineering.uchicago.edu), as well as Argonne National Lab’s initiative around AI+science and climate science.

**Postdoc applicants**: More information about the potential projects, required qualifications, and application process can be found [here](https://pedram.rice.edu/files/2023/08/Postdoc-positions-climate-extremes-and-AI.pdf). The start date is flexible (anytime from now until 1/6/2025). Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis. The review will continue until all of the positions are filled. We encourage you to submit your application (or reach out) as soon as possible, even if you are interested in starting dates after the Spring of 2025.

A number of prestigious opportunities at UChicago, including the campus-wide [Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://aiscience.uchicago.edu), [T. C. Chamberlin Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://geosci.uchicago.edu/academics/information-for-postdocs/chamberlin-fellowship/), [DSI Postdoctoral Scholarship](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/research/postdoctoral-programs/dsi-scholars/), [CSEi Postdoctoral Research Program](https://climateengineering.uchicago.edu/csei-postdoctoral-researchers-program/), and [Kruskal Instructor](https://cam.uchicago.edu/people/#kruskal-instructors) at the Committee of Computational and Applied Mathematics are available for outstanding applicants.

**Research scientist positions**: Outstanding applicants for the above positions with more than 3 years of postdoc experience will be considered for appointment as research scientists.

**Ph.D. applicants for Fall/Spring 2025**: More information about the potential projects, required qualifications, and application process can be found here. Depending on an applicant’s research interests and educational background, they can apply to the [Ph.D. programs in Geophysical Sciences](https://geosci.uchicago.edu/academics/graduate-program-and-admissions/), [Computational and Applied Mathematics](https://cam.uchicago.edu/academics/graduate-programs/), [Data Science](https://codas.uchicago.edu/academics/phd-in-data-science/), or other disciplines in UChicago’s [Physical Sciences Division](https://physicalsciences.uchicago.edu/academics/academic-departments/#PhD).
