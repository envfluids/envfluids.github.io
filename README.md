# Climate Extremes Theory and Data (CeTD) Group Website Repository

This is the repository for the [Climate Extremes Theory and Data (CeTD) Group](https://envfluids.github.io) website. The website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the [al-folio theme](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio).

This website was put together by [Adam Marchakitus](mailto:marchakitus@uchicago.edu) and [Pedram Hassanzadeh](mailto:pedramh@uchicago.edu). 

## Website Editing

To edit pages on the website, you can clone the repository to your local machine and edit the files using a text editor or an IDE, and then push the changes back to the repository. Alternatively, you can edit the files directly on GitHub using the web interface. Reach out to Adam if you need to obtain write access to the repository.


## License

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/blob/main/LICENSE).

Originally, **al-folio** was based on the [\*folio theme](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio) (published by [Lia Bogoev](https://liabogoev.com) and under the MIT license). Since then, it got a full re-write of the styles and many additional cool features.
